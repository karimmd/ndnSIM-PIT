# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links
link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)

# bandwidth: link bandwidth

# metric: routing metric

# delay:  link delay

# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
