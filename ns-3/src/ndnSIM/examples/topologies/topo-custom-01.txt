# The file should contain exactly two sections: router and link, each starting with the corresponding keyword
#
# router section defines topology nodes and their relative positions (e.g., to use in visualizer)
router

# each line in this section represents one router and should have the following data
# node     comment          yPos    xPos

# Note that `node` can be any string. It is possible to access to the node by name using Names::Find, see examples.

# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links
link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)

# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue

# bandwidth: link bandwidth

# metric: routing metric

# delay:  link delay

# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
